//
// Declaration of a class that implements a skeletal version of a
// string.  Your goal in this project is to implement this class
// precisely according the specification given below; no more, no
// less.  Each of the member functions is described in comments
// within the class declaration below.  Additionally, you will find
// unit tests in the "gtest" directory that will provide some
// examples of how each of them should behave.
//
// You can feel free to add private member variables and private
// member functions -- in fact, you'll certainly need to add
// private members -- but *do not* modify any of the public member
// functions and *do not* add new ones.
//
// Implement all of your member functions (even the simple ones
// that you think might better be defined inline) in the source
// file "String.cpp".
//
// Note that the comments below make reference to OutOfBoundsException,
// which you'll find declared in "OutOfBoundsException.hpp".
